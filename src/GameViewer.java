     * going to be out of range, I move the y coordinate of the printed word down to the row. I have this if statement
     * in the  for loop because I need to check this for every word (the user could enter a few really long words and
     * need to move onto the next line a couple of times).
     *
     * I technically have a while loop in my code, but itâ€™s in the loadDictionary() method, which I got from spellingBee.
     * A while loop can be used to run a function/method/etc that has an unknown amount of times it will change
     * (it could also be used when there is a known amount of times something will run). For example, a person would use
     * a while loop to continuously perform an action until the game is won.
     *
     * I also used many for loops in throughout my program, but a specific example of it is in the printFoundWords()
     * method. I want to print every word in the foundWords ArrayList, so I used a for loop that went until i < then
     * the size of foundWords. I also do a check every time in this for loop to see if the words would be printed off
     * the page.
