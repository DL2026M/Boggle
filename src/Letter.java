     * tell each letter their (x,y) cords, position on the grid, their specific image, if they have been visited, their
     * name, and the ascii value associated with that letter. I have a constructor that takes their name as a char
     *(an if statement to see check for qu). In addition, I have a bunch of getter and setters for all of these instance
     * variables. All the getters and setters are public as they need to be accessed from other classes and the
     * instance variables are private because they are just used in the letter class.
